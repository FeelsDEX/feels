We're excited to introduce Feels Protocol, a next-generation concentrated liquidity AMM on Solana that reimagines how decentralized exchanges should work.

## The Problem with Current AMMs

Traditional AMMs suffer from capital inefficiency and fragmented liquidity across multiple pools. Users often face high slippage and complex routing paths when swapping between tokens.

## Our Solution: Hub-and-Spoke Architecture

Feels Protocol introduces a revolutionary hub-and-spoke model where all tokens trade through a central FeelsSOL base pair. This design ensures:

- **Maximum liquidity concentration**: All liquidity for a token is in one place
- **Simple routing**: Maximum 2 hops for any trade (TokenA → FeelsSOL → TokenB)
- **Capital efficiency**: Concentrated liquidity positions maximize returns

## Physics-Based Trading Model

Our unique 3D trading model incorporates three dimensions:
- **Spot**: Traditional price discovery
- **Time**: Time-weighted average pricing
- **Leverage**: Built-in leverage capabilities

This creates a more dynamic and efficient market that better reflects real trading conditions.

## What's Next

We're launching on Solana mainnet soon. Join our community to stay updated on the latest developments.

The future of DeFi feels good, man.

# Introduction

## Welcome to Feels Protocol

Feels Protocol is a concentrated liquidity AMM on Solana implementing a physics-based 3D trading model with hub-and-spoke routing.

## Key Features

### Hub-and-Spoke Architecture
All tokens trade through a universal FeelsSOL base pair, creating bounded routing with maximum 2 hops.

### Concentrated Liquidity
Provide liquidity in specific price ranges for maximum capital efficiency.

### Physics-Based Model
Three-dimensional trading incorporating spot price, time-weighted pricing, and leverage.

### Built on Solana
Lightning-fast transactions with minimal fees.
